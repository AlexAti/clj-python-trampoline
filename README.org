* Motivation

I want to use libpython-clj from an already running python process, without needing any special python builds.

* Examples

[[examples/blender]]

* Implementation

- *javabridge* provides the python -> jvm connection.
- *libpython-clj* is patched at runtime, to be able to use it from inside an existing python process. This patch is experimental and will certainly break something.
