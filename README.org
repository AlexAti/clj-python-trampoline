* Motivation

I want to use libpython-clj from an already running python process, without needing any special python builds.

* Examples

- [[examples/blender]]

* Assumptions

*javabridge* is installed with your local "pip3" command, which should be installing to the python environment that blender uses.

(Tested on Fedora 31)

* Implementation

- *javabridge* provides the python -> jvm connection.
- *libpython-clj* is patched at runtime, to be able to use it from inside an existing python process. This patch is experimental and will certainly break something.
